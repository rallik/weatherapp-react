# PhotoWeathter (Client)

This repo contians the ReactJS frontend for my app PhotoWeather, the one-stop weather app for photographers. The app features a map (street and satellite views) with radar, live weather data from the OpenWeather API, and a visualization for sun events throughout the day. Check the app out at: https://confident-clarke-ddd6fc.netlify.app/
